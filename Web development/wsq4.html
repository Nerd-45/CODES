        In the final, India lost the toss and were asked to bat first against the West Indies. 
        Only Krishnamachari Srikkanth (38 from 57 balls) and Mohinder Amarnath (26 from 80 balls) 
        put up any significant resistance as Roberts,
         Marshall, Joel Garner and Michael Holding ripped through the Indian batsmen, 
         ably supported by Gomes. Surprising resistance by the tail allowed 
         India to compile 183 (all out, 54.4 overs).</pre></p>

        In Group D, after initial games against Scotland, 
        rivals India and Pakistan met at Kingsmead Cricket Ground, 
        Durban, South Africa.[1][2] After India got to 141 for 9 
        in their twenty overs, a Misbah-ul-Haq run-out
         on the last ball of the game saw the match head 
         into a bowl-out which India won 3–0 with Virender Sehwag,
          Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa scoring for India.[3]
